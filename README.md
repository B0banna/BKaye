# Python Mad Libs Game

A very simple command-line Mad Libs game written in Python.  
The program asks the user for a few words and then inserts them into a short story.

This project was created as a first step in building a Python and GitHub portfolio.

## How It Works

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter:
- an adjective
- a noun
- a place
- a verb

The program then uses these inputs to generate a short, playful story.

## Example Output

Welcome to Mad Libs!  
Enter an Adjective: funny  
Enter a noun: banana  
Enter a place: london  
Enter a verb: dance  

One day, a funny cat decided to jump over a giant banana.  
Everyone in the town of London started to dance in excitement!

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Run the file from the terminal:

madlibs.py


## Future Improvements

- Add more words and a longer story
- Include multiple story templates chosen at random
- Add basic input validation
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds
